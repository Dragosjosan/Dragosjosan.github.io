title: 'CV - Reddit''s resume knowledge packed into a Multi Agent System'
---
## Introduction

I always get my best ideas while doing something. This time I was re-writing my resume the 1000th time, and looking for advice on reddit, from 'the locals'. 

Then it struck me! Why don't we pack all this knowledge from the kind germans of reddit into an agent, then scale it and help other people as well.

If you are curious on how a resume should look like in Germany, feel free to browse the[cscareerquestionsEU](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/) subreddit.

## Why building an resume maker specific for the german market?

Not only that we go through a higly competitive maket but there are subtle cultural stuff one should pay attention to. Without going into the details, a simple example is that germans culturally don't like boasting, and hate phrases like `increased efficency by 1000% because I'm that awsome`.

This is why I've build Br√§in-IO's CV. It's the little things that make the difference!

## Key Features
